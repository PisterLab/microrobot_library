# microrobot_library

This is a set of programs to aid in MEMS microrobot design and layout.

The '''matlab''' folder contains a MATLAB library with scripts that can generate 2D layout files for a wide range of microfabricated structures, from rectangles with etch holes to complete electrostatic inchworm motors. See '''matlab/README.md''' for more information.
