# microrobot_library

This is a set of programs to aid in MEMS microrobot design and layout.

The 'matlab' folder contains a MATLAB library with scripts that can generate 2D layout files for a wide range of microfabricated structures, from rectangles with etch holes to complete electrostatic inchworm motors. See 'matlab/README.md' for more information.

The 'python' folder contains the beginnings of a python library with scripts that do the same. Using python rather than MATLAB may allow easier integration with external programs in the future.
