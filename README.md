# MEMS_Microrobot_Library

This repository is a MATLAB library designed to aid in MEMS microrobot design and layout. Generally, this library
can be used for any application requiring the generation of .GDS files directly from MATLAB.  

This repository is built upon (and requires) the work done by Ulf Griesmann to generate an Octave/MATLAB toolbox 
capable of generating .GDS files. We took this basic library and built additional functions that range in complexity
from generating a simple rectangle, to generating an entire microrobot. 

Ulf's work can be found on his github page here: https://github.com/ulfgri/gdsii-toolbox

Or downloaded directly here: https://sites.google.com/site/ulfgri/numerical/gdsii-toolbox

After installing Ulf's gdsii-toolbox, clone this repository and run the tutorial.m script. Make sure both the gdsii-toolbox and this repository are in your MATLAB PATH.   

Version 1 of the Microrobot Library was built using version 141 of Ulf's gdsii-toolbox.
